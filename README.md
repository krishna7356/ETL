## Introduction

Welcome to the Realtime Data Processing Pipeline project, a comprehensive guide to building a robust end-to-end data engineering solution. This project will take you through the entire process, from data ingestion to processing and storage, utilizing a powerful technology stack including Apache Airflow, Python, Apache Kafka, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Spark, Cassandra, and PostgreSQL. To simplify deployment and enable scalability, the entire system is containerized using Docker.

## Architecture Overview

![System Architecture](https://example.com/path/to/your/architecture_diagram.png)

The project encompasses the following components:

- **Data Source**: Utilizes the `randomuser.me` API to generate random user data, serving as our data source.
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates the pipeline and stores fetched data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Apache Kafka and Zookeeper**: Facilitates real-time data streaming from PostgreSQL to the processing engine.
- **Control Center and Schema Registry**: Enables monitoring and schema management of Kafka streams.
- **Apache Spark**: Employs data processing capabilities with master and worker nodes.
- **Cassandra**: Serves as the storage solution for processed data.

## Key Learning Points
